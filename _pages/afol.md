From childhood, I've always been fascinated with creativity and become an [AFOL](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/AFOL) after contacting Lego, thus my rich imagination does have a proper space to play. [Modular Buildings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Modular_Buildings#Mini_Modulars) are my favorites because of their attention to details and specifications, where I'm addicted to the sense of accomplishment that comes from hand-crafting a world.

This sense of accomplishment drives me to touch coding, which corresponds to hand-crafting the virtual world compared to bricks.
